# sso-and-translation-layer-db-monitor
Record all manual database updates/changes for SSO and Translation Layer projects

## Branch Naming Convention
We are using a specific naming convention for branches in Github to provide consistency across developers and projects that execute manual queries outside of code repositories.

> Branch names will include the following data elements separated by a hyphen “-” symbol:

* Story Type (i.e. Insert/Update/Delete)

* Database

* Developer Initials

* Jira Ticket Number

Example:

**{ Insert/Update } / { SSO/TL } - { Developer Initials } - { Jira Ticket # }**

> Update/sso-lr-ktlo-12345
